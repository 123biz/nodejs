Welcome to the English-language Wiktionary, 
a collaborative project to produce a free-content multilingual dictionary. 
It aims to describe all words of all languages using definitions and descriptions in English. Wiktionary has grown beyond ${txt} 
a standard dictionary and now includes a ${txt} thesaurus, a rhyme guide, phrase books, language statistics and extensive appendices. We aim to include not only the definition of a word, but also enough information to really understand it. Thus etymologies, pronunciations, sample quotations, synonyms, antonyms and translations are included. ${txt}`;
